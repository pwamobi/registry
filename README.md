## The Vision

The web was always the greatest open platform ever built. No gatekeepers. No permission required. Anyone with a domain and an idea could reach the world.

Then app stores arrived — and slowly, quietly, they became toll booths.

**30% of every transaction.** Weeks of opaque review processes. Policies that change overnight. The power to remove your business with a single email. Developers lost control of their distribution, their revenue, and their relationship with their users.

**pwa.mobi exists to change that.**

Progressive Web Apps have matured to the point where the gap between a PWA and a native app is narrower than most people realize. Offline support, push notifications, camera access, payments, near-native performance — it's all there, built on open web standards, accessible from a URL.

This registry is the trust layer that makes it real. A community-verified directory where developers list their PWAs freely, users discover apps they can trust, and nobody takes a cut of anyone's revenue.

> *The web is the platform. It always was.*

---

## What This Registry Is

This repository is the **single source of truth** for all PWAs listed in the pwa.mobi directory.

- ✅ **Fully open source** — every listing, every audit result, publicly auditable
- ✅ **Submission by Pull Request** — transparent, community-reviewable process
- ✅ **Automated audit pipeline** — GitHub Actions runs checks on every submission
- ✅ **Human reviewed** — a maintainer reviews every passing audit before merge
- ✅ **Zero fees** — free to list, free forever, we take nothing
- ✅ **No binaries hosted** — we index URLs, developers own and host everything

---

## How It Works

```
Developer forks repo → adds YAML file → opens Pull Request
                                              ↓
                              GitHub Actions runs automated audit
                              (HTTPS · Manifest · Service Worker ·
                               Lighthouse · Security Headers ·
                               Safe Browsing · Schema validation)
                                              ↓
                              ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                              │  Pass → labeled audit-passed  │
                              │  Fail → bot comments issues   │
                              └──────────────────────────────┘
                                              ↓
                              Maintainer reviews → merges PR
                                              ↓
                              registry.json auto-rebuilds
                                              ↓
                              App appears live on pwa.mobi/directory
```

## For Developers — Local Validation

Before opening a PR, validate your YAML file locally:

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/registry.git
cd registry

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Validate your submission
npm run validate apps/your-app-name.yaml
```

This catches schema errors and basic issues before the CI pipeline runs.

Also check your Lighthouse PWA score at [web.dev/measure](https://web.dev/measure) — aim for 85+.
